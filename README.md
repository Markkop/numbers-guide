# ðŸ”® Numbers' Guide

This is a pretty simple Alexa Skill that calculates a number for a given date (and perhaps a name in the future) and retrieves a description for it.  
Currently it's only available in pt-BR.

# Get the Skill

# How to develop

```
ask configure
ask init --hosted-skill-id amzn1.ask.skill.316649f9-4d83-464f-a085-57620934aef1
cd lambda && npm install && cd ..
git remote add github git@github.com:Markkop/numbers-guide.git
```

Compiled folder "dist" have to be commited since this project is a Alexa-hosted skill (which is free) and therefore we have to build the javascript code before sending it to Amazon.
